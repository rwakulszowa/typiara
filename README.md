# typiara
A library defining a set of generic abstractions useful for implementing type checking logic.

## Code style
Whatever hindent and hlint told me to do.

## Performance
The library is in an early stage where performance is not the top priority.
Wherever applicable, the code is written in a way that sacrifices performance for correctness. 

The implementation is expected to change over time, once the high level becomes more stable.
